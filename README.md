## General Information
Essentially, the company wants â€”

Build a model that finds the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

 - To identify the variables affecting bike demand, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.

 - To create a linear model that quantitatively relates bike demand with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.

 - To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict bike demand.
